# Hi there, I'm @f-matanza 👋

## About Me
I'm currently a **B.Sc. Artificial Intelligence** student in my 4th semester with a strong passion for **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, **Data Analysis**, and programming languages like **Python** and **R**. My academic journey has fueled my curiosity in these areas, and I'm eager to apply my knowledge in real-world projects.

## What I'm Interested In 👀
- **Machine Learning**: Developing and implementing models that can learn and make predictions based on data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring how agents can learn to make decisions by interacting with environments.
- **Data Analysis**: Extracting insights from data.
- **Programming**: Enhancing my coding skills, especially in Python and R.

## Currently Working On 🌱
Alongside my studies, I'm taking specialized courses to further sharpen my skills. Currently I'm also looking forward to attending an RL Bootcamp soon to further deepen my expertise.

## Hobbies and Interests 🏁 🐾 ♟️
Besides my keen interest in motorsports, I enjoy spending my free time with my family, two cats and a dog. I also like to play chess.
